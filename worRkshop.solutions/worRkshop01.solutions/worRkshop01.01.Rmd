```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# This logical variable indicates whether to include various solutions
# If you change it to True, and you don't have access to 
include.solutions <- FALSE
```

**Exercise 01** gives you an opportunity to gain experience in

* Using `R` via the `Rstudio` interface
* Using `RMarkdown`, [an authoring framework for data science](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html), to combine commentary and analysis in a style known as [literate programming](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-literate-programming/02-literate-programming/index.html)
* Using `Knit` to compile your commentary and execute your analysis into an HTML file
* Viewing that HTML file in your browser

## Prelude to Exercise 01

Before making any changes to this file, check to see that you can knit this `Rmarkdown` file

* Type `Ctrl+Shift+K`  
OR  
click on the `Knit` button at the top of the code editing screen  
OR  
select the `Knit to HTML` option in the dropdown menu next to the `Knit` button at the top of the code editing screen

You _should_ be rewarded by activity in the `RMarkdown` panel of `RStudio`

You _may_ experience some kind of problem

* Don't panic. These things often happen because our computing environments are set up differently.
  * This can especially be the case if you have had `R` and `RStudio` installed for a while so `R` and its many packages are at different versions
  * You might see messages like  
  `Error: package 'markdown' was installed before R 4.0.0: please re-install it`
  * The solution is to go to the `Packages` tab (in one of the four  `RStudio` "panes"), click `Install` then type the name of the package that needs reinstallation
  * If you have a different issue, please consult your tutor and be happy that you are doing this in a Workshop and not 48 hours before your assignment is due

# Exercise 01  

This exercise involves using `RMarkdown`. To find out more about this way of combining `R` code and commentary please

* Open up the Markdown Quick Reference in `Rstudio` (under the `Help` menu)
* Take a look at the RMarkdown Cheat Sheet (under the `Help > Cheatsheets` menu)

Your exercise is to reproduce the output that appears between the two horizontal lines below as displayed in the file `./pdf/woRkshop 01 Exercise 01.pdf`.

* OK, you don't have to reproduce it exactly, but you do have to know how to achieve the various kinds of formatting demonstrated.

# Key elements of `RMarkdown`

## Text elements

`RMarkdown` lets us use plain text to indicate where to put things in **bold** or *italics* or in a `code font`.

## List elements

### Bulleted lists

* Item 1
* Item 2
    + Item 2a
    + Item 2b
    
### Numbered lists

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
    + Item 3a
    + Item 3b
    
## Line Breaks and Blockquotes

Line breaks  
are not so obvious.

## `R` Code

There are two main ways to include `R` Code so that it is executed. First, as a chunk of code. An empty block can be inserted by typing `Ctrl+Alt+I` or clicking on the `Insert` button at the top right of this editing pane


```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- 2^x
y
```

The second way to insert `R` code is inline, e.g., the value of `x` is `r x`

## Mathematics

`RMarkdown` supports mathematics using $\LaTeX$ typesetting conventions (written as `$\LaTeX$`). 

You can produce beautiful equations like $e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0$ inline, or as a display equation:
$$
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
$$

-----------------

Don't worry if you didn't make it through all that... the main thing is to have got a sense of what you can do with `RMarkdown` and understand the concept of [literate programming](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-literate-programming/02-literate-programming/index.html)
